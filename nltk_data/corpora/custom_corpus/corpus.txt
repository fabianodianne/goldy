Compound words are two or more words that are formed or
combined to present one idea or new meaning.

A closed compound word results from two distinct words joined together and written
without a space between or as one word only.
Example:
baseball bookstore rainbow raindrop moonlight
grandfather afternoon sunrise weekend backyard
thanksgiving resthouse outside sailboat bathtub

An open compound word is the result of two distinct words joined together. However,
the words are written separately, with a space between them.
Example:
solar system ice cream rocket ship black hole post office
field trip parking lot crown prince whole number air conditioner
security guard full moon high school living room school bus

A hyphenated compound word uses a symbol called a hyphen (-) to connect two or
more words.
Example:
merry-go-round sister-in-law ten-year-old close-up long-term
worn-out well-scrubbed best-looking up-to-date God-fearing
get-together self-esteem runner-up on-site x-ray

Compound words are two or more words that are formed or combined to present one idea
or new meaning.
They are written in three (3) ways:
1. A closed compound word results from two distinct words joined together and written
without a space between or as one word only.
2. An open compound word is the result of two distinct words joined together. However,
the words are written separately, with a space between them.
3. A hyphenated compound word uses a symbol called hyphen (-) to connect two or
more words.

Knowledge of compound words improves our vocabulary and helps us learn more about
the English language. It helps us improve our writing and speech skills. In our day-to-day life,
we must always be willing to learn.
We also have to be resourceful in addressing our difficulties so we can manage the different
challenges in our life. Thus, we must learn to adjust, accept, and adapt to these challenges.
